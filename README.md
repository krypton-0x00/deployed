1. **Git Integration**:

   - Integrate with popular Git hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to allow users to connect their repositories.
   - Implement OAuth flows or personal access token authentication to securely access user repositories.
   - Monitor user repository webhooks to automatically detect when new commits are pushed.

2. **Build Automation**:

   - When a new commit is detected, trigger a build process to fetch the user's repository.
   - Analyze the repository to detect the type of application (static site, Node.js, etc.) and the appropriate build command.
   - Use tools like webpack, Parcel, or Next.js to build the user's application.
   - Generate optimized, production-ready assets (HTML, CSS, JS) from the build process.

3. **Deployment**:

   - Integrate with cloud hosting providers like AWS S3, Netlify, or your own infrastructure to deploy the built assets.
   - Assign a unique URL or subdomain for each user's deployed application.
   - Set up continuous deployment so that every new commit triggers an automatic rebuild and re-deployment.
   - Provide options for custom domains, SSL/TLS certificates, and other deployment settings.

4. **Serverless Functions**:

   - Allow users to deploy serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) alongside their web applications.
   - Provide a way for users to specify the serverless function entry point and configure any necessary environment variables.
   - Integrate the serverless functions with the user's web application using techniques like API proxying.

5. **Deployment Logs and Status**:

   - Maintain a detailed log of each deployment, including build steps, errors, and deployment status.
   - Expose this information to users through the web dashboard and CLI tool, allowing them to troubleshoot issues.
   - Provide real-time updates on the deployment status, such as "Fetching repository", "Building application", "Deploying to hosting", etc.

6. **Rollbacks and Previews**:

   - Allow users to view a history of their deployments and roll back to a previous version if needed.
   - Provide a way for users to preview their application before it goes live, such as a staging environment or a unique preview URL.

7. **CLI Integration**:
   - Develop a command-line interface (CLI) tool that users can install and use to interact with your platform.
   - The CLI should allow users to connect their Git repositories, trigger deployments, view logs, and manage their applications.
   - Integrate the CLI with the main platform API to provide a seamless user experience.
