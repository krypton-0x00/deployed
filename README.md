1. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - Break down your application into smaller, independent services, such as:
     - User Authentication Service
     - Repository Management Service
     - Build and Deployment Service
     - Hosting Service
   - Use Docker to containerize each service and manage their deployment.
   - Implement inter-service communication using a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) or an API gateway.

2. **Git Integration Service**:
   - Create a dedicated microservice responsible for handling Git integration.
   - This service will be responsible for:
     - Connecting to Git hosting providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) using OAuth or personal access tokens.
     - Monitoring webhooks from the Git hosting providers to detect new pushes.
     - Fetching the user's repository contents when a new commit is detected.
     - Providing an API for other services to access the user's repository data.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement a user authentication service using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and integrate it with the Git integration service.
   - Ensure that users can only access their own repositories and not those of other users.
   - Provide options for team-based collaboration and access control.

4. **Build and Deployment Service**:
   - This service will be responsible for building the user's application and deploying it to the hosting infrastructure.
   - It should integrate with the Git integration service to fetch the user's repository contents.
   - Analyze the repository to determine the appropriate build process (e.g., React, Next.js, Node.js) and generate optimized assets.
   - Coordinate with the Hosting service to deploy the built assets.

5. **Hosting Service**:
   - Manage the infrastructure for hosting the user's applications, such as AWS S3, Netlify, or your own custom solution.
   - Provide APIs for the Build and Deployment service to upload and manage the user's deployed applications.
   - Handle tasks like domain management, SSL/TLS configuration, and scaling.

6. **Real-time Updates with WebSockets**:
   - Use WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) to provide real-time updates to the user's dashboard and CLI.
   - The Git integration service can emit events through the WebSocket channel when new commits are detected or deployments are in progress.
   - The user-facing components (web dashboard, CLI) can subscribe to these events and update the UI accordingly.

7. **CLI Integration**:
   - Develop a command-line interface (CLI) tool that users can install and use to interact with your platform.
   - The CLI should integrate with the various microservices to provide a seamless user experience.
   - Users should be able to connect their Git repositories, trigger deployments, view logs, and manage their applications through the CLI.
