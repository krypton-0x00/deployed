1. **Set up the service**:
   - Create a new Node.js/Express.js service within your microservices architecture.
   - Configure environment variables for git hosting provider credentials (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and other necessary settings.

2. **Implement Git Provider Integrations**:
   - Use libraries like `octokit` (for GitHub), `gitlab-api` (for GitLab), or `bitbucket-api` (for Bitbucket) to interact with the respective Git hosting providers.
   - Implement OAuth flows or personal access token authentication to securely access user repositories.
   - Provide APIs for fetching repository metadata, contents, and commit history.

3. **Webhook Handling**:
   - Set up webhook endpoints to receive notifications from the Git hosting providers when new commits are pushed.
   - Validate the webhook payloads to ensure they come from the expected source.
   - Trigger repository synchronization and notify other services (e.g., Build and Deployment Service) about the new commit.

4. **Repository Management**:
   - Create a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store information about the user's connected repositories.
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing the user's repository connections.
   - Associate the repositories with the user's account using the Authentication Service.

5. **API Endpoints**:
   - Expose APIs for users to list their connected repositories, fetch repository details, and trigger manual synchronization.
   - Implement authorization checks to ensure users can only access their own repositories.
   - Provide an API for other services (e.g., Build and Deployment Service) to fetch the user's repository contents.

6. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle failures in Git provider integrations or webhook processing.
   - Log relevant information (e.g., errors, successful operations) for debugging and monitoring purposes.

7. **Integration with Other Services**:
   - Communicate with the Authentication Service to verify user credentials and permissions.
   - Notify the Build and Deployment Service whenever a new commit is detected, providing the necessary repository information.
   - Integrate with the Hosting Service to retrieve deployment-related information (e.g., URLs, status) for the user's applications.

8. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Write unit and integration tests to ensure the Git Integration Service is functioning as expected.
   - Package the service into a Docker container and deploy it alongside the other microservices.
   - Configure environment variables, networking, and any other necessary settings for the containerized service.
